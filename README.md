# Ganymede

Ganymede is my game, story, and repository. It is an acknowledgment of the "Everything is a remix" meme and is my attempt at collating inspiration and trying to define my mental landscape a little. Inevitably, Ganymede draws inspiration from the games and experiences that have left indelible impressions on me. Here is a list of the things I have been inspired by (consciously):

## Purpose

I'm documenting my inspirations and influences as part of my personal knowledge base, which functions similarly to a RAG vector database. This collation serves as a glossary to help readers understand references that may seem unclear or bugged, offering context for confusing facets of the writing.


## Notes

My work is a blend of fiction and personal knowledge. While I aim to minimize real-world and historical inspirations to avoid the need for an extensive sociology knowledge base, a quick search on Google or Wikipedia should clarify any obscure, cultural, or historic references or misspellings. Any real-world person or event of sufficient involvement in my story/game will have a duplicate page in `~/ganymede`. For example, Einstein, Bohr, Noether, etc., are all nodes in my other knowledge bases.

I adore science fiction and am attempting to write what I consider cutting-edge science fiction. This requires not only worldbuilding and Tolkien-esque pursuits (language, culture, history) but also significant rigor. There's a reason it has taken me this long to begin in earnest: calculus and differential equations, signal processing, complex math/numbers, and general relativity.

### Philosophical and Cultural References

I am a marxist anticapitalist and an occasional anarchist. As for spirituality I do suppose Siddhartha Gautama was probably the closest thing to a prophet I've ever conceived of but its not a big deal or something I'm particularly interested in or have put any scholarship or thought into (any of the prophets/religions). I'm more or less convictionless in the matter of religion instead seeing philosophy and to a lesser extent cognitive science & psychology as a way of understanding the world and the universe (from an undergraduate at best level of conception).
